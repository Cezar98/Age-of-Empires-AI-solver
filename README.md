**Project Scope**

The current scope of this project is to develop an AI capable of learning and completing the first scenario of the Ascent of Egypt campaign ("Hunting") in Age of Empires: Definitive Edition. If this initial stage proves successful, the project may be extended to additional scenarios.

**Approach**

The initial methodology is based on genetic algorithms, though alternative approaches may be considered as the project evolves.

**Objective**

Train the AI to create seven villagers in the shortest possible time.

**Assumptions**

No enemy units or threats are present.

Gold and stone resources are irrelevant.

Resource gathering is limited to food and wood (although wood collection may be non-beneficial, this will be left for the AI to determine through exploration).

**Fitness Function**
The AIâ€™s performance will be evaluated primarily by the in-game score, which at this stage is largely influenced by the number of villagers produced. Achieving victory will add an additional 1000 points to the score.
